# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Example

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bug.java` file contains code that throws this exception. The `bugSolution.java` file shows the corrected code.

This exception occurs when you try to access an element in an array using an index that is either negative or greater than or equal to the array's length.  Always double-check your array indices to avoid this issue.
